# docx-translator
My sister would translate my father's sermons from Korean to English. She would occasionally ask me if I could just copy and paste from Google Translate to help her out. Then, she could just fix the grammar. Thus, I decided to try and automate this task because I'd rather watch a show than spend half an hour wearing out my keys.
